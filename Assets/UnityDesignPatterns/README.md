# Unity Design Patterns

This project contains examples of the three main types of design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each pattern is demonstrated with a C# script tailored for Unity.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main folders, each representing a type of design pattern:

- `CreationalPatterns`: Contains examples of Creational design patterns such as Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, and Singleton.

- `StructuralPatterns`: Contains examples of Structural design patterns such as Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.

- `BehavioralPatterns`: Contains examples of Behavioral design patterns such as Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

Each script file within these folders provides a practical example of the respective design pattern.

## Usage

To use these examples, simply import the scripts into your Unity project and attach them to your game objects as needed. Each script is self-contained and demonstrates a specific design pattern.
